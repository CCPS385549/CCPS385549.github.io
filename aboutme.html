In my professional life I want to work towards is to become a commercial pilot or a flight attendant and if all hell breaks lose I will love to become a teacher. The experiences that would lead me there are my studies and my social life.The way I am working towards my personal goals are by exploring and challenging my mentality and working hard on my self image. I plan on working towards my professional goals by working hard in school so I make it into Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. For my back of plan of becoming a teacher I am going to continue with the childcare program that is provided here at my school. I do have values that I consider most necessary for my success. One of my values I consider necessary is my education and my hard work in challenging my mind. Another value I consider necessary and my social skills and how I work well in different environments. These are great values that I would need for my success. Some short term goals I want to accomplish in the near future are getting A's and B's 3rd quarter and becoming a Sophomore. A personal goal I will like to accomplish is turning 15 and and to enjoy the end of my freshman year. These short term goals are all easy to accomplish and I wish I do. Some characteristics I would like to be known is for having a bubbly personality and being a nice and caring person. Achievements I would like to be know for is for being a great sister, daughter, friend.Â  This is what I would like to be known for.</p>
